Dr. John Hawkins is the Chief Scientist with [Playground XYZ](https://playgroundxyz.com/)
and a machine learning researcher affiliated with the 
[Transitional AI Group](https://transitional-ai.github.io/) out of UNSW. 

He has worked across multiple industries applying machine learning to business problems and 
published academic research in the application and analysis of machine learning systems.
His current research interests are in advanced text prcocessing, model interpretation, algorithmic
reasoning and quantification of uncertainty. He continues to develop multiple open source
libraries for these projects in a commitment to open and reproducible data science.


Projects
==============

## Uncertainty Quantification and Media Impact in Eye Tracking Studies

Multiple streams of research aimed at understanding and improving processes for
measuring eye tracking based consumer attention on digital media.
  
* [Estimating Gaze Duration Error from Eye Tracking Data](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3591156.3591166)
* [Evaluating Ad Creative and Web Context Alignment with Attention Measurement](https://camps.aptaracorp.com/ACM_PMS/PMS/ACM/ICCDA2023/1/f3c42a18-7222-11ee-b37c-16bb50361d1f/OUT/iccda2023-1.html)
* [Brands, Verticals and Contexts: Coherence Patterns in Consumer Attention](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373213816_Brands_Verticals_and_Contexts_Coherence_Patterns_in_Consumer_Attention)
 
## Natural Language Processing for Systematic Review in Biomedical Research

An investigation into machine learning methods for automated filtering of research
papers extracted from biomedical database seraches.


## Minimum Viable Model Estimation

To what extent can we quantify in advance how good a machine learning system needs to be in order to solve a 
problem? In this work we are building tools to estimate the required performance levels of a model in order
to meet business requirements specified in terms of the minimal ROI and the expected returns for predictions
of differing levels of accuracy.

* MinViME Library available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/minvime/) or [Github](https://github.com/john-hawkins/minvime)


## Interpretable Text in Machine Learning

Modern advances in interpretable machine learning are generally less applicable to text data sources.
In this work we are exploring methods to render the contributions of unstructured text data more transparent 
regardless of how it is being processed or the machine learning model that is used.
 
* [What's in a Domain? Analysis of URL Features](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373237120_What%27s_in_a_Domain_Analysis_of_URL_Features)
* Texturizer Library available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/texturizer/) or [Github](https://github.com/john-hawkins/texturizer)
* Textplainer Library in development. [Github](https://github.com/john-hawkins/textplainer)


## Data Science Project Management & Integration 

Data science projects require rapid experimentation and exploration of problem spaces. 
This is typically enabled by using loosely coupled tools and processes. In this work we are 
developing simple CLI tooling for connecting data and experimental
resources so that results can easily be compared and managed without undue coupling and dependency creation.

* Projit library and command line tool: [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/projit/) or [Github](https://github.com/john-hawkins/projit)


## Automated Bayesian Neural Networks for Time Series Forecasting

Exploring the design of an automated Bayesian forecasting system to automate the development of time-series
forecasting in a manner that provides reliable quantifictions of forecast error.

Dr. John Hawkins is the Chief Scientist with [GumGum](https://gumgum.com/), director of
Artificial Intelligence research with the non-profit [Pingla Institute](https://pingla.org.au)
and a machine learning researcher affiliated with the 
[Transitional AI Group](https://transitional-ai.github.io/) out of UNSW. 

He works across multiple industries applying machine learning to business problems and 
publishing academic research in the application and analysis of machine learning systems.
His current research interests are in advanced text prcocessing, model interpretation, 
algorithmic reasoning and the quantification of uncertainty. 
He continues to develop multiple open source libraries for these projects in a commitment 
to open and reproducible data science.


Projects
==============

## Uncertainty Quantification and Media Impact in Eye Tracking Studies

Multiple streams of research aimed at understanding and improving processes for
measuring eye tracking based consumer attention on digital media.

* Estimating Attention Thresholds for Brand Impact - (Submitted)  
* [Estimating Gaze Duration Error from Eye Tracking Data](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3591156.3591166)
* [Evaluating Ad Creative and Web Context Alignment with Attention Measurement](https://camps.aptaracorp.com/ACM_PMS/PMS/ACM/ICCDA2023/1/f3c42a18-7222-11ee-b37c-16bb50361d1f/OUT/iccda2023-1.html)
* [Brands, Verticals and Contexts: Coherence Patterns in Consumer Attention](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373213816_Brands_Verticals_and_Contexts_Coherence_Patterns_in_Consumer_Attention)
 
## Natural Language Processing, Reasoning and Explainability

Investigations into applications and interpretations of machine learning methods for 
pure text based systems: including classification, generation and reasoning from text.
Projects including classification of internet content and
filtering of research papers extracted from biomedical database searches.

* [Literature Filtering for Systematic Reviews with Transformers](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3676581.3676582)
* [Enhanced Review Detection and Recognition: A Platform-Agnostic Approach with Application to Online Commerce](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06704)

Modern advances in interpretable machine learning are generally less applicable to text 
data sources. We are exploring methods to render the contributions of unstructured 
text data more transparent regardless of how it is being processed or the machine 
learning model that is used.
 
* [What's in a Domain? Analysis of URL Features](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373237120_What%27s_in_a_Domain_Analysis_of_URL_Features)
* Texturizer Library available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/texturizer/) or [Github](https://github.com/john-hawkins/texturizer)
* Textplainer Library in development. [Github](https://github.com/john-hawkins/textplainer)


## Minimum Viable Model Estimation

To what extent can we quantify in advance how good a machine learning system needs to be 
in order to solve a problem? In this work we are building tools to estimate the required 
performance levels of a model in order to meet business requirements specified in terms of 
the minimal ROI and the expected returns for predictions of differing levels of accuracy.

* [MinViME/Minimum Viable Model Estimator](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.simpa.2021.100073)
* [Minimum Viable Model Estimates for Machine Learning Projects](https://aircconline.com/csit/abstract/v10n18/csit101803.html)
* MinViME Library available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/minvime/) or [Github](https://github.com/john-hawkins/minvime)


## Data Science Project Management & Integration 

Data science projects require rapid experimentation and exploration of problem spaces. 
This is typically enabled by using loosely coupled tools and processes. In this work we are 
developing simple CLI tooling for connecting data and experimental
resources so that results can easily be compared and managed without undue coupling and dependency creation.

* Projit library and command line tool: [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/projit/) or [Github](https://github.com/john-hawkins/projit)

Contextual targeting is a common strategy that places marketing messages
in media locations that are aligned with a target audience.
The challenge of contextual targeting is knowing the ideal schema and
the set of categories that provide the right audience.
Refinement of the contextual targeting process has been
limited by the use of metrics that are either rapid but
unreliable (click through rates), or reliable
but slow, expensive and inaccessible in real-time (conversions or brand awareness).

In this study we evaluate the use of attention measurement as a technique for
understanding the alignment between advertising creatives and media contexts.
We perform the analysis using
a large scale dataset of impressions categorised using the iAB V2.0 taxonomy. We
evaluate the alignment by looking for consistency across time in the attention
a given creative attracts over the levels of the categorisation hierarchy.

Our research is the largest known study of the relationship between advertising creative,
media context and consumer attention. We provide strong empirical evidence that consumer
attention is related to an alignment between the creative execution and topics of media
context. Furthermore, we show that this relationship transcends any specific publication
by providing reliable indications of attention on new website domains.

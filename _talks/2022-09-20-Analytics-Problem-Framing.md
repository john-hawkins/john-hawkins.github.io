In this guest lecture at the Australian Graduate School of Management 
we discussed a range of fundamental ideas in analytics projects.
All of these ideas relate to framing problems such that they have a 
greater chance of success.

Key topics included types of analytics solutions and their requirements,
the choice of metrics, and understanding the timing between data collection, 
model building, decisions being made, action being taken and measuring impact.
